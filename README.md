# Encoder and Decoder

This software has the ability to encode or decode texts in English with authorial encryption

- Explanation: 
  - The encoding software works based on a key that will serve as the basis for creating the encoding, so to create your own key it is necessary that it has all the characters present in the text you want to encode. It is not recommended to use '~' in the key, but you can use 'ã', 'õ', etc.
